"""Canonical team identity: one id per program, across every data source.

Each dataset spells schools its own way. NCAA team stats say ``"Eastern Ill."``,
the player leaderboards say ``"EIU"``, draft records say ``"Eastern Illinois
University"``, and RPI says ``"Eastern Illinois"``. This module maps all of them
onto one ``team_id``, so datasets can be joined.

    >>> resolve_team("Eastern Ill.")
    'IPEDS:148496'
    >>> resolve_team("EIU") == resolve_team("Eastern Illinois")
    True

Identity notes
--------------
The id is the federal IPEDS unitid where one is known (``"IPEDS:230171"``),
because it survives rebrands -- Dixie State and Utah Tech share an id, as do
Houston Baptist and Houston Christian. Programs with no unitid get a minted
``"NCAA:<slug>"`` id.

**Division is not part of identity.** A program that changes division keeps one
id and one history; division is recorded per season by :func:`team_seasons`.

Deliberately uses the standard library rather than pandas, so importing it stays
cheap for callers that only need a name lookup.
